# Mock API Manager & Request Logger

A lightweight React frontend paired with a FastAPI backend to manage mock API endpoints, send HTTP requests, log the requests and responses, and view request history â€” all with a clean pastel-themed UI.

---

## Features

- **Mock API Manager**:  
  Create, view, and delete mock API routes with customizable HTTP methods and JSON responses.

- **Request Form**:  
  Send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to any URL with custom JSON payloads, view responses, and log these requests automatically.

- **Request History**:  
  Browse all logged requests with details like method, URL, request body, response status, and response body.

- **View All Mocks**:  
  Display a list of all currently active mock routes.

- **Responsive UI**:  
  Pastel-themed, clean, and mobile-friendly interface with responsive tables and forms.

---

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React (Functional Components, Hooks)  
- Backend: FastAPI (Python) with SQLAlchemy and SQLite/Postgres for data persistence  
- Styling: CSS with a pastel color palette and responsive design principles

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)  
- Python 3.8+  
- `pip` package manager

---

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repo and navigate to the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
````

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The backend API will run at `http://localhost:8000`.

---

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder (or root if combined):

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Usage

* Open the React app in your browser.
* Use the **Mock API Manager** to create mock routes and responses.
* Use the **Request Form** to send HTTP requests to any API, including your mocks.
* View all previous requests and their responses in **Request History**.
* Browse all mocks in **View Mocks**.

```

---

## Customization

* Update the pastel theme by editing the CSS file (`styles.css`).
* Configure backend database by modifying `database.py`.
* Extend API endpoints or frontend features as needed.

---

## Troubleshooting

* Ensure backend is running on port 8000 before using the frontend.
* Check CORS settings if API calls fail due to cross-origin restrictions.
* Verify JSON format correctness in request and response bodies.
